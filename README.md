# Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio showcasing some of the work that I've done as part of the coding bootcamp through the University of Utah. It's based on the one created at the beginning of the class using only HTML and CSS, this time including using React. The functionality is in place to easily add more projects as well as new project categories that can then be sorted on the page.
